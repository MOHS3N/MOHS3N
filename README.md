# 📝 About Me

> ### **Survivor of the `undefined` Era | 🦀 Rust Convert**
>
> I’m **Mohsen**, a battle-scarred survivor of the `undefined is not a function` civil wars. I spent years in a world where `[] + {}` inexplicably results in `"[object Object]"` and where asking `0 == "0"` yields a bold, shameless **"True!"**. After wasting half my youth debugging errors that only seemed to manifest in the end-user's browser, I realized I hadn't picked my nerves up off the street.
>
> For a while, I took refuge in **Python**, gaslighting myself with its simple syntax: *"Yeah Mohsen, life is easy, just relax!"* But deep down, I knew it was just the calm before the storm. Eventually, after escaping the hell of toxic logic, I found my way to the heaven of **Rust**. It's a place where the compiler acts like a caring (yet slightly obsessive) brother—grabbing my collar before execution to make sure I don't blow the entire memory on a single mistake.
>
> Currently, I’m busy migrating my legacy projects from the chaos of `JS` to the iron-clad order of `Rust`; because life is far too short to spend it worrying about `null` variables at `Runtime`!
